## 📖 About the Project

**Wonderful World of Manipulative Marketing (WWMM)** is an artistic and educational platform that makes manipulative marketing techniques visible through experiential learning. Created by students in the **CCM (Comprendre & Changer le Monde)** program at **ESSEC Business School**, WWMM transforms marketing techniques into interactive, narrative worlds where visitors can experience influence first-hand.

WWMM operates as a **playground, not a classroom**—visitors learn by doing rather than by explanation. By placing people inside playful environments where influence can be felt, knowledge becomes awareness that shapes future automatic decisions.

This project is part of the **Marketing for Betterment** initiative and serves three purposes:
- **Individual awareness**: Help people recognize manipulative techniques in their daily digital experiences
- **Scientific research**: Provide an experimental environment for studying awareness, persuasion, and resilience
- **Policy support**: Offer concrete illustrations of manipulative techniques to support regulatory discussions

## 📝 Note
